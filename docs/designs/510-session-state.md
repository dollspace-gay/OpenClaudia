# Design: Centralized SessionState (crosslink #510)

## Problem

OpenClaudia's per-session state is scattered across three concrete types and an assortment of unrelated modules:

- `tui::app::App` — the TUI event-loop struct (~30 fields)
- `tui::app::TuiSession` — the persistence struct (title / model / behavior / messages / undo_stack / plan_mode / approved_plan)
- `cli::repl::ChatSession` — the chat-REPL persistence struct (near-clone of TuiSession with a different serde format)
- Scattered Arcs: `memory_db`, `permission_mgr`, `hook_engine`, `plugin_manager`, `service_registry` (from #511) — each owned by whichever surface instantiates them
- Miscellaneous: `behavior_mode` on ChatSession, `effort_level` on App, IDE state on AcpServer (#517), todo thread-local (#518), transcript watermark on App (#516).

Consequences of the scatter:
1. **Field threading**: adding a new piece of session state requires touching multiple constructors, serde structs, and call sites (e.g. #518 had to add `SessionIdGuard` across 10+ call sites instead of reading from a central context).
2. **Drift**: TuiSession vs ChatSession have the same fields with subtly different defaults and serde layouts. Load-saved-in-TUI-resume-in-chat is not round-trip safe.
3. **No event bus**: when a session switch happens (`/load`, `/resume`, `/new`), there's no listener mechanism — every dependent subsystem polls or gets plumbed a new handle. Claude Code uses `tokio::sync::broadcast` for `on_session_switch`; OC has nothing equivalent.
4. **Hard to snapshot**: `/rewind`, `/dream`, `/compact` all want a coherent snapshot of "what does the agent know right now". Today they cobble it together from App fields manually.

Claude Code's equivalent: `Arc<RwLock<SessionState>>` singleton with ~98 fields grouped into 12 semantic categories and ~210 getter/setter exports. Detailed in `claude-code-design-documents/.design/state-management.md` REQ-1.

## Proposed architecture

Introduce `src/state/` as the home of a single `SessionState` struct plus `StateStore` wrapper with change-notification. Migrate fields into it across several phases so no single PR is "rewrite everything".

### Key abstractions

```rust
/// The single source of truth for one session. Grouped by concern

/// than in a flat list of 98 fields. Each sub-struct is plain data —
/// no Arcs — so the whole thing is cheap to clone for snapshots.

    pub identity: Identity,
    pub conversation: Conversation,

    pub transcript: TranscriptState, // from #516, watermark lives here
    pub worktree: Option<WorktreeState>,
    pub teleport: Option<TeleportInfo>,
}

/// Who / where / which (7 fields from CC's REQ-1 "Identity" group).

}

impl StateStore {
    pub fn read(&self) -> RwLockReadGuard<'_, SessionState>;
    pub fn write(&self) -> StateWriteGuard<'_>;   // guard that emits on drop

    pub fn subscribe(&self) -> broadcast::Receiver<StateEvent>;
}

/// Emitted from inside StateWriteGuard on drop. Granular events let
/// subscribers (analytics sink, transcript writer, TUI redraw) react

### Arcs live outside SessionState

`memory_db`, `permission_mgr`, `hook_engine`, `plugin_manager`,
`service_registry` — these are **process-scoped** handles, not
per-session state. They stay on a separate `AppHandles` struct that
gets passed alongside `StateStore` wherever both are needed. Keeping
them out of SessionState keeps serialization + snapshots simple.

### Persistence is a separate concern

`state/persist.rs` owns one serde-compatible shape (`SessionStateV1`)
that both the TUI and the chat REPL emit. Today's divergent
`TuiSession` / `ChatSession` struct are deprecated to compat shims
that deserialize-then-convert. New sessions land in the V1 shape; a
migration (via #506's framework) rewrites old files lazily on read.

## Integration plan (phased)

The migration must be incremental — a single-PR rewrite would stall.
Each phase compiles + tests green on its own.

**Phase 0 — ship the module, empty**
- Create `src/state/` with the structs above. Nothing uses it yet.
- `SessionState::new(...)` constructs from existing `TuiSession` for compat.
- Tests: default construction, roundtrip serde.

**Phase 1 — migrate Identity + Conversation**
- Replace `App.chat_session.messages` / `App.chat_session.id` reads with `StateStore::read().conversation.messages` / `identity.session_id`.
- Same for the REPL. `TuiSession` / `ChatSession` forward to the new fields.
- Tests: `/load`, `/resume`, `/undo`, `/redo` still pass.

**Phase 2 — migrate BudgetsState + UiState**
- `App.effort_level` → `state.budgets.effort_level`.
- Plan-mode UI flags move.
- Tests: `/effort`, `/plan`, `/mode` still pass.

**Phase 3 — migrate Permissions / Transcript / IDE**
- `App.transcript_watermark` → `state.transcript.watermark`.
- Permission flags move.
- `AcpServer::ide_state` reads from `StateStore`, writes propagate.
- Tests: existing IDE-bridge tests still pass.

**Phase 4 — StateEvent broadcast**
- Analytics sink subscribes; emits `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` from `SessionSwitched`.
- Transcript writer subscribes; `MessageAppended` triggers `persist_transcript_tail` automatically.
- Tests: subscribe → drive switch → assert event fires.

**Phase 5 — delete TuiSession / ChatSession compat shims**
- Only after every caller migrated.
- Migration `m0xx_session_state_v1` rewrites on-disk old-format files to V1 on first load.

Phases 0–2 are single-commit each. Phases 3–4 are two-commit each. Phase 5 requires the migrations framework (already shipped in #506) and lands last.

## Test strategy

- `state::mod::tests` — field-per-field serde roundtrip against a golden JSON fixture.
- `state::store::tests` — subscribe-fires-on-change, write-guard-drop emits event, concurrent readers don't starve writers.
- Migration test: load an existing fixture of TuiSession JSON, assert the resulting V1 shape is lossless.
- Every phase's commit passes the whole suite — the phased plan is what keeps that tractable.

## Risks and open questions

1. **Deadlock via lock holding**. `RwLockReadGuard` held across an `.await` is a recipe for deadlocks in async paths. Guard against this by keeping read guards short-lived (clone out the field you need) and never holding a write guard across any await. Consider using `parking_lot` instead of `std::sync::RwLock` for the consistent-priority policy.
2. **Broadcast channel bound**. `tokio::sync::broadcast` drops messages when the receiver falls behind. Subscribers must handle `RecvError::Lagged` — easy to forget. Ship a helper `StateStore::subscribe_log_lag()` that wraps recv + logs on lag so every caller gets the same behavior.
3. **Serialization drift with plugins**. Plugins persist per-plugin config (already in #514 policy work); keep those out of `SessionState` so the version-bump cost stays bounded to core fields.
4. **Migration atomicity**. Phase 5 rewrites every old session file. Must be crash-safe: write-temp + rename. Reuse the file-atomicity helpers the transcript writer already uses.
5. **Observability during the migration**. Each phase adds a tracing span around the `StateStore::write` call. If a user reports a broken `/undo` mid-migration, we can grep the log for which phase/writer moved the field without sprinkling `eprintln!`s.
6. **API stability**. `pub` fields on `SessionState` let callers reach in directly, which feels nice but locks the shape. Counter-pattern: make fields `pub(crate)` and expose `read().identity()` accessors. Trade-off: borrow-checker ergonomics vs future flexibility. Recommend: `pub(crate)` fields + `pub fn` getters.

## Out of scope

- Sync with a remote state backend (CC's `remote/` handles this; ours would come via a future issue if SDK / remote-session parity is pursued)
- Telemetry / stats counters — those belong on `services::analytics` (#511), not SessionState
- Scheduled-tasks persistence — lives on its own `ScheduledTasksStore` if the `cron` feature is ever re-enabled
