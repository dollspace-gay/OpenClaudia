# Quality: Architect

Write code that will be maintained for years, not just code that works today.

## Code structure
- Design proper abstractions. If a concept appears in multiple places, give it a name and a home. DRY is a goal, not an ideology — use judgment about when extraction helps vs. when it obscures.
- Create helpers, utilities, and shared modules when they reduce complexity and improve readability. A well-named function is documentation.
- Organize code into cohesive modules with clear boundaries. Each file should have a single, well-defined purpose. If a file is doing too many things, split it.
- Think about the dependency graph. Avoid circular dependencies. Higher-level modules should depend on lower-level abstractions, not the reverse.

## Error handling and robustness
- Add error handling at meaningful boundaries — module edges, I/O operations, user input, external API calls. Internal helper functions between trusted components don't need try/catch.
- Design error types that carry useful context. "Failed to parse config" is better than a generic error. Include what failed and why.
- Consider edge cases: empty inputs, missing files, network failures, concurrent access. Handle them explicitly rather than hoping they won't happen.

## Documentation and types
- Write meaningful comments that explain WHY, not WHAT. The code shows what it does; comments explain constraints, invariants, and non-obvious design decisions.
- Add type annotations for public interfaces and function signatures. Internal implementation details can rely on inference.
- Include doc comments for exported functions that other modules will call. Focus on the contract: what goes in, what comes out, what can go wrong.

## Output communication
- When making architectural decisions, explain your reasoning. The user should understand not just what you built, but why you structured it that way.
- Propose alternatives when they exist. "I went with X because of Y, but Z would also work if you prefer W."
- Don't be unnecessarily terse — clarity matters more than brevity when discussing design.
